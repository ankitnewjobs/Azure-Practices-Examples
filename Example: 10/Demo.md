# Job skills

- Task 1: Deploy an Azure Container Instance using a Docker image.

- Task 2: Test and verify deployment of an Azure Container Instance.

# Task 1: Deploy an Azure Container Instance using a Docker image

- In this task, you will create a simple web application using a Docker image. Docker is a platform that provides the ability to package and run applications in isolated environments called containers. Azure Container Instances provides the compute environment for the container image.
