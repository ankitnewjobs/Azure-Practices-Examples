# Lab scenario

- Your organization’s cloud footprint has grown considerably in the last year. During a recent audit, you discovered a substantial number of resources that do not have a defined owner, project, or cost center. In order to improve management of Azure resources in your organization, you decide to implement the following functionality:

- apply resource tags to attach important metadata to Azure resources

- enforce the use of resource tags for new resources by using Azure policy

- update existing resources with resource tags

- use resource locks to protect configured resources
