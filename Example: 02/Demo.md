# Lab scenario
Your organization is building a new lab environment for pre-production testing of apps and services. A few engineers are being hired to manage the lab environment, including the virtual machines. To allow the engineers to authenticate by using Microsoft Entra ID, you have been tasked with provisioning users and groups. To minimize administrative overhead, membership of the groups should be updated automatically based on job titles.

# Task 2: Create groups and add members

In this task, you create a group account. Group accounts can include user accounts or devices. These are two basic ways members are assigned to groups: Statically and Dynamically. Static groups require administrators to add and remove members manually. Dynamic groups update automatically based on the properties of a user account or device.

# In the Azure portal, search for and select Groups.

- Take a minute to familiarize yourself with the group settings in the left pane.

- Expiration lets you configure a group lifetime in days. After that time the group must be renewed by the owner.
- Naming policy lets you configure blocked words and add a prefix or suffix to group names.

Microsoft Entra ID has user and guest accounts. Each account has a level of access specific to the scope of work expected to be done.
Groups combine together related users or devices. There are two types of groups including Security and Microsoft 365.
Group membership can be statically or dynamically assigned.
